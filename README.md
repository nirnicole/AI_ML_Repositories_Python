note:
due to copyrights i have posted only the parts i wrote for the well known pacman school project i've worked on.

# CSP:
Constraint satisfaction problems
you can see a basic framework for the csp.
topics coverd in csp.py (framework file):
- Backtrack algorithm
- AC-3 algorithm
- MRV,Degree,LCV heuristics
- Minimum-Conflicts algorithm

also a few problem impltmentaions in tester.py such as:
- CrossWord puzzle
- Coloring map puzzle
- 8-queens csp solver
- N-queens local csp solver with Minimum-conflicts huristic approach

you can also find a tester to run those and see solutions and time assessments

I will post here varius algorithms and concepts i will explore in the AI course im currently on!

# enjoy!
