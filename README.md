# Artificial Intelligence (python)
I will post here varius algorithms and concepts i will explore!

# CSP:
Constraint satisfaction problems, <br/>
you can see a basic framework for the csp.<br/>
<br/>
topics coverd in csp.py (framework file):
- Backtrack algorithm
- AC-3 algorithm (constraint propagation)
- Minimum-Conflicts algorithm
- MRV,Degree,LCV heuristics

also a few problem impltmentaions in tester.py such as:
- CrossWord puzzle
- Coloring map puzzle
- 8-queens csp solver
- N-queens local csp solver with Minimum-conflicts huristic approach

# Searches:
Graph Searches in Graph_Searches.py:
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Uniform Cost Search (Dijkstra)
- A*

Local Searches in Genetic_Algorithm.py:
- Genetic algorithm

# enjoy!
