due to copyrights i have posted only the parts i wrote for the well known pacman school project i've worked on.

# CSP:
constrained search problems
you can see a basic framework for the csp,
and a few impltmentaions such as:
- CrossWord puzzle
- Coloring map puzzle
- 8-queens csp solver
- N-queens local csp solver with Minimum-conflicts huristic approach

you can also find a tester to run those and see solutions and time assessments

I will post here varius algorithms and concepts i will explore in the AI course im currently on!
enjoy!
